#### I'm currently working on ...
##### A discord bot!
I'm currently working on a Pokemon themed discord bot, to emulate a Pokemon game *inside* discord!
Release: *Hopefully* by February 28th, 2023

##### Various code golfing problems
I have a public repo called [code-golfing](https://www.github.com/Fenrir0279/code-golfing) in which I solve various small coding questions in as few characters as possible!


#### I'm currently learning ...
Nothing for now, but hope to learn:
* Rust
* C++
* C
* How to properly package code and publish it. (Adding good README.md, license, documentation, etc.)

#### Pronouns
I use he/him pronouns. I'm a typical cisgender male.

#### Fun fact
Ice cream is the best thing to ever grace this world. If you disagree, I don't like you.
